# Events Backend - Quick Setup Guide

## 🎯 Overview

This feature adds event management capabilities to the NFC Attendance System. Events are activities hosted by organizations that can be used for attendance tracking.

## 📋 What's Included

- **Database Schema**: Complete SQL setup with RLS policies
- **Service Layer**: Business logic for event operations
- **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints for event management
- **TypeScript Types**: Full type definitions
- **Documentation**: API reference and feature summary

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Database Setup

**IMPORTANT**: Run the complete SQL setup script

#### Option A: Use Standalone SQL File (Recommended)

1. **Open** `documents/setup-events.sql`
2. **Copy** the entire file contents
3. **Paste** into Supabase SQL Editor
4. **Run** the script
5. **Verify** the results at the end

#### Option B: Use Documentation

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Create a new query

2. **Copy Complete Setup Script**
   - Open `documents/EVENTS_BACKEND_SETUP.md`
   - Copy the **entire "Complete Setup Script"** section
   - This single script includes:
     - ✅ Events table creation
     - ✅ All indexes for performance
     - ✅ Row-level security policies
     - ✅ Automatic timestamp trigger
     - ✅ Verification queries

3. **Run the Script**
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" or press Ctrl+Enter
   - Wait for execution to complete

4. **Verify Setup**
   - Check the output of the verification queries at the end
   - Should see:
     - "Events table created successfully!"
     - "RLS is ENABLED ✓"
     - "Total policies: 4"
     - "Total indexes: 6"

#### Prerequisites Check

Before running the script, verify these tables exist:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor first
SELECT 
  table_name,
  'EXISTS ✓' as status
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name IN ('users', 'organizations', 'organization_members')
  AND table_schema = 'public';
```

You should see all 3 tables. If any are missing:
- For `users`: See [USER_BACKEND_SETUP.md](./USER_BACKEND_SETUP.md)
- For `organizations` and `organization_members`: See [ORGANIZATION_BACKEND_SETUP.md](./ORGANIZATION_BACKEND_SETUP.md)

#### Optional: Add Test Data

To populate sample events for testing:

1. **Open** `documents/test-data-events.sql`
2. **Replace** placeholder UUIDs with actual organization and user IDs
3. **Run** the script in Supabase SQL Editor
4. **Verify** test events were created

### 2. Verify Setup

The backend code is already in place. Just verify:

- ✅ Types defined in `src/types/event.ts`
- ✅ Service layer in `src/lib/services/event.service.ts`
- ✅ API routes in `src/app/api/event/`

### 3. Test API

Test the endpoints using curl or your favorite API client:

```bash
# Get all events
curl http://localhost:3000/api/event

# Create an event
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/event \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event_name": "Team Meeting",
    "date": "2025-11-15T14:00:00.000Z",
    "organization_id": "your-org-id",
    "description": "Monthly sync",
    "location": "Room 101"
  }'
```

## 🔑 Key Features

### Event Management
- Create, read, update, delete events
- Search and filter capabilities
- Date range queries
- Organization-specific event lists

### Permissions
- All members can **view** events
- Owner, Admin, Attendance Taker can **create/update** events
- Owner, Admin can **delete** events

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/event` | List all user events |
| POST | `/api/event` | Create new event |
| GET | `/api/event/[id]` | Get event details |
| PUT | `/api/event/[id]` | Update event |
| DELETE | `/api/event/[id]` | Delete event |
| GET | `/api/organization/[id]/events` | List organization events |

## 🎨 Frontend Integration (Next Steps)

To integrate with the frontend:

1. **Create Event Components**
   - Event list view
   - Event creation form
   - Event detail page
   - Event edit form

2. **Add Navigation**
   - Link to events from organization pages
   - Dashboard widgets for upcoming events

3. **Implement Features**
   - Calendar view
   - Event search
   - Filters (date range, organization)

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create an event with all fields
- [ ] Create an event with only required fields
- [ ] View event list
- [ ] Filter events by organization
- [ ] Filter events by date range
- [ ] Search events
- [ ] Get upcoming events
- [ ] Get past events
- [ ] Update an event
- [ ] Delete an event
- [ ] Test permission checks (different roles)

### Test Different Roles

- [ ] Owner: Can create, update, delete
- [ ] Admin: Can create, update, delete
- [ ] Attendance Taker: Can create, update (not delete)
- [ ] Member: Can only view

## 🔄 Commit History

This feature was built with clean commit history for easy rollback:

1. `feat: add event types and interfaces`
2. `feat: add events database schema and setup documentation`
3. `feat: implement event service layer with CRUD operations`
4. `feat: implement event API routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)`
5. `docs: add comprehensive events documentation`

Each commit is atomic and can be reverted independently if needed.

## ⚠️ Prerequisites

Before using this feature, ensure you have:

- ✅ Supabase project set up
- ✅ Organizations feature implemented
- ✅ Users table and authentication
- ✅ Next.js 14+ with App Router
- ✅ TypeScript configured

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Events not showing up?
- Check user is a member of the organization
- Verify RLS policies are enabled
- Check database foreign key constraints

### Permission errors?
- Verify user role in organization
- Check organization membership
- Review RLS policy definitions

### Date issues?
- Always use ISO 8601 format
- Include timezone information
- Verify date is valid timestamp

## 🚦 Next Steps

After setting up the events backend:

1. **Frontend Development**
   - Build UI components
   - Create event pages
   - Integrate with API

2. **Attendance Integration** (Future)
   - Link events to attendance records
   - NFC/QR code check-in
   - Attendance reports

3. **Enhanced Features** (Future)
   - Recurring events
   - Event notifications
   - Capacity limits
   - Event templates

## 💡 Tips

- Use TypeScript types for type safety
- Handle errors gracefully in API calls
- Always validate user permissions
- Test with different user roles
- Use date filters for better performance

## 📞 Support
